# PCore (PHP Core)

PCore is an attempt to create a lightweight and easily extensible open source library for PHP 7.0 and above. It aims to provide a foundation for the creation of new PHP web apps which includes basic functionality for component based dynamic page creation and more.

README will be updated in the future and a documentation will be provided should the project come to light.
